## Foundational Principles

Understanding these f4st principles is essential to this topic:

### 1. **Interface-First Thinking**

How do developers interact with this feature? Design the API/patterns before implementation.

### 2. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**

Don't add complexity "just in case." Use the simplest approach that solves the current problem.

### 3. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**

Extract common patterns and reuse them. Avoid duplicating similar logic across the codebase.

### 4. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**

Choose boring, well-established tools over trendy alternatives. Simplicity aids maintainability.
