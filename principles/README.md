# Principles

## Goal

Enable teams to build and evolve frontend systems through **clear ownership**, **strong collaboration**, and **intentional design**, so products remain understandable, adaptable, and valuable as they scale.

## Core Principles

### 1. Clear Ownership

Every problem, feature, and decision has a clear owner.  
Ownership includes quality, outcomes, and long-term maintainability.

---

### 2. Explicit Boundaries

Work is structured around clear boundaries — between features, responsibilities, and teams.  
Cross-boundary collaboration is intentional and visible.

---

### 3. Shared Understanding

Decisions are made with shared context, not assumptions.  
Architecture, product intent, and trade-offs are documented and communicated.

---

### 4. Simplicity Over Cleverness

Solutions favor clarity and maintainability over short-term optimization or technical cleverness.

---

### 5. Composition Over Accumulation

Systems, processes, and teams grow by combining small, focused parts — not by piling on exceptions, flags, or ad-hoc rules.

---

### 6. Change Is Expected

Change is not a failure of planning.  
Designs, processes, and collaboration models must support safe evolution and learning.

## Guiding Rule

> **Own clearly. Structure intentionally. Communicate openly. Keep things simple. Build by composition. Design for change.**
